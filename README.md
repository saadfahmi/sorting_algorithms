# Sorting Algorithms & Big O 🚀

This repository contains implementations of common sorting algorithms in C, along with their Big O notations. These algorithms demonstrate various sorting techniques and their respective performance characteristics.

---

## Overview 📖

This project showcases different sorting algorithms implemented in C. It is intended to serve as a resource for understanding sorting concepts, their performance, and practical implementation.

## Implemented Algorithms 🛠️

Here is a list of the sorting algorithms included in this repository:

- **Bubble Sort** (`0-bubble_sort.c`) 🌊
- **Insertion Sort (linked list)** (`1-insertion_sort_list.c`) 📋
- **Selection Sort** (`2-selection_sort.c`) 🔍
- **Quick Sort** (`3-quick_sort.c`) ⚡

## Big O Analysis 📊

Each algorithm's time complexity is analyzed in terms of:
- Best Case 🟢
- Average Case 🟡
- Worst Case 🔴

The Big O analysis is detailed in the corresponding files labeled `0-O`, `1-O`, `2-O`, and `3-O`.
