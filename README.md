# Sorting Algorithms & Big O

This repository contains implementations of common sorting algorithms in C, along with their Big O notations. These algorithms demonstrate various sorting techniques and their respective performance characteristics.

---

## Overview

This project showcases different sorting algorithms implemented in C. It is intended to serve as a resource for understanding sorting concepts, their performance, and practical implementation.

## Implemented Algorithms

Here is a list of the sorting algorithms included in this repository:

- **Bubble Sort** (`0-bubble_sort.c`)
- **Insertion Sort (linked list)** (`1-insertion_sort_list.c`)
- **Selection Sort** (`2-selection_sort.c`)
- **Quick Sort** (`3-quick_sort.c`)

## Big O Analysis

Each algorithm's time complexity is analyzed in terms of:
- Best Case
- Average Case
- Worst Case

The Big O analysis is detailed in the corresponding files labeled `0-O`, `1-O`, `2-O`, and `3-O`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saadfahmi/sorting_algorithms.git
   cd sorting_algorithms
